SmartyBundle
============

This `Symfony2 <http://symfony.com/>`_ bundle provides integration for the `Smarty3 <http://www.smarty.net/>`_ template engine.

.. contents:: **Contents**

Introduction
------------

This bundle was created to support `Smarty <http://www.smarty.net/>`_ in Symfony2, providing an alternative to the `Twig <http://twig.sensiolabs.org/>`_ template engine natively supported.

    An effort was made to provide, where possible, the same user configuration and extensions available for the Twig bundle. This is to allow easy switching between the two bundles (at least I hope so!).

What is Smarty?
+++++++++++++++

Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. This implies that PHP code is application logic, and is separated from the presentation.

Some of Smarty's features: [#]_

* It is extremely fast.
* It is efficient since the PHP parser does the dirty work.
* No template parsing overhead, only compiles once.
* It is smart about recompiling only the template files that have changed.
* You can easily create your own custom functions and variable modifiers, so the template language is extremely extensible.
* Configurable template ``{delimiter}`` tag syntax, so you can use ``{$foo}, {{$foo}}, <!--{$foo}-->``, etc.
* The ``{if}..{elseif}..{else}..{/if}`` constructs are passed to the PHP parser, so the ``{if...}`` expression syntax can be as simple or as complex an evaluation as you like.
* Allows unlimited nesting of sections, if's etc.
* Built-in caching support.
* Arbitrary template sources.
* Template Inheritance for easy management of template content.
* Plugin architecture.

See the `Smarty3 Manual <http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/>`_ for other features and information on it's syntax, configuration and installation.

Installation
------------

Download SmartyBundle
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This can be done in several ways, depending on your preference. The first method is the standard Symfony2 method.

**Using the vendors script**:

Add the following lines in your ``deps`` file:::

    [NoiseLabsSmartyBundle]
        git=git://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle.git
        target=bundles/NoiseLabs/Bundle/SmartyBundle

Now, run the vendors script to download the bundle::

    $ php bin/vendors install


**Using submodules**:

If you prefer instead to use git submodules, then run the following::

    $ git submodule add git://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle.git vendor/bundles/NoiseLabs/Bundle/SmartyBundle
    $ git submodule update --init

Configure the Autoloader
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Add the ``NoiseLabs`` namespace to your autoloader::

    <?php
    // app/autoload.php

    $loader->registerNamespaces(array(
        // ...
        'NoiseLabs\\Bundle' => __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles',
    ));


Enable the bundle
++++++++++++++++++++

Enable the bundle in the kernel::

    <?php
    // app/AppKernel.php

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new NoiseLabs\Bundle\SmartyBundle\SmartyBundle(),
        );
    }

Enable the Smarty template engine in the config
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

::

    # app/config/config.yml
    # ...
    templating:      { engines: ['twig', 'smarty'] }
    # ...

Usage
-----

Basic usage
+++++++++++

You can render a Smarty template instead of a Twig one simply by using the **.tpl** extension in the template name instead of .twig. The controller below renders the index.html.tpl template::

    // src/Acme/HelloBundle/Controller/HelloController.php

    public function indexAction($name)
    {
        return $this->render('AcmeHelloBundle:Hello:index.html.tpl', array('name' => $name));
    }

Template Inheritance
++++++++++++++++++++

Like Symfony2 PHP renderer or Twig, Smarty provides template inheritance.

    Template inheritance is an approach to managing templates that resembles object-oriented programming techniques. Instead of the traditional use of ``{include ...}`` tags to manage parts of templates, you can inherit the contents of one template to another (like extending a class) and change blocks of content therein (like overriding methods of a class.) This keeps template management minimal and efficient, since each template only contains the differences from the template it extends.

**Example:**

`layout.html.tpl`::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>{block name=title}Default Page Title{/block}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {block name=body}{/block}
    </body>
    </html>

`mypage.html.tpl`::

    {extends 'file:AcmeHelloBundle:Default:layout.html.tpl'}
    {block name=title}My Page Title{/block}
    {block name=body}My HTML Page Body goes here{/block}

Output of mypage.html.tpl::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        My HTML Page Body goes here
    </body>
    </html>

Instead of using the ``file:AcmeHelloBundle:Default:layout.html.tpl`` syntax you may use ``file:[WebkitBundle]/Default/layout.html.tpl`` which should be, performance wise, slightly better/faster (since this is a native Smarty syntax).::

    {extends 'file:[WebkitBundle]/Default/layout.html.tpl'}

To load a template that lives in the ``app/Resources/views`` directory of the project you should use the following syntax::

    {extends 'file:base.html.tpl'}

Please see `Symfony2 - Template Naming and Locations <http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/templating.html#template-naming-locations>`_ to learn more about the naming scheme and template locations supported in Symfony2.

**{include} functions** work the same way as the examples above.::

    {include 'file:WebkitBundle:Default:layout.html.tpl'}
    {include 'file:[WebkitBundle]/Default/layout.html.tpl'}
    {include 'file:base.html.tpl'}

**Important:** Note the usage of the ``file:`` resource in the ``{extends}`` function. We need to declare the resource even if the Smarty class variable ``$default_resource_type`` is set to ``'file'``. This is required because we need to trigger a function to handle 'logical' file names (only mandatory if you are using the first syntax). Learn more about resources in the `Smarty Resources <http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/resources.tpl>`_ webpage.

    The `.html.tpl` extension can simply be replaced by `.tpl`. We are prefixing with `.html` to stick with the Symfony convention of defining the format (`.html`) and engine (`.tpl`) for each template.

Injecting variables into all templates (i.e. Global Variables)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As exemplified in the `Symfony Cookbook <http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/templating/global_variables.html>`_ it is possible to make a variable to be accessible to all the templates you use by configuring your `app/config/config.yml` file::

    # app/config/config.yml
    smarty:
        # ...
        globals:
            ga_tracking: UA-xxxxx-x

Now, the variable ga_tracking is available in all Smarty templates::

    <p>Our google tracking code is: {$ga_tracking} </p>

Extensions
----------

Smarty[Bundle] extensions are packages that add new features to Smarty. The extension architecture implemented in the SmartyBundle is an object-oriented approach to the `plugin system <http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/plugins.tpl>`_ available in Smarty. The implemented architecture was inspired by `Twig Extensions <http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/extensions.html>`_.

Each extension object share a common interest (translation, routing, etc.) and provide methods that will be registered as a Smarty plugin before rendering a template. To learn about the plugin ecosystem in Smarty take a look at the `Smarty documentation page <http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/plugins.tpl>`_ on that subject.

The SmartyBundle comes with a few extensions to help you right away. These are described in the next section.


Actions Extension
+++++++++++++++++

This extension tries to provide the same funcionality described in `Symfony2 - Templating - Embedding Controllers <http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/templating.html#embedding-controllers>`_.

Following the example presented in the link above, the Smarty equivalent is::

    {render max='3'}AcmeArticleBundle:Article:recentArticles{/render}


Assetic Extension
+++++++++++++++++

*Coming soon*


Assets Extension
++++++++++++++++

Templates commonly refer to images, Javascript and stylesheets as assets. You could hard-code the path to these assets (e.g. ``/images/logo.png``), but the SmartyBundle provides a more dynamic option via the ``assets`` function::

    <img src="{asset}images/logo.png{/asset}" />

    <link href="{asset}css/blog.css{/asset}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

This bundle also provides the ``assets_version`` function to return the version of the assets in a package. To set the version see the `assets_version configuration option in Symfony's Framework Bundle <http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/reference/configuration/framework.html#ref-framework-assets-version>`_.

Usage in template context::

    {assets_version}


Form Extension
++++++++++++++

*Coming soon*.


Routing Extension
+++++++++++++++++

To generate URLs from a Smarty template you may use two block functions (``path`` and ``url``) provided by the `RoutingExtension <https://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle/tree/master/Extension/RoutingExtension.php>`_.

::

    <a href="{path slug='my-blog-post'}blog_show{/path}">
        Read this blog post.
    </a>

Absolute URLs can also be generated.::

    <a href="{url slug='my-blog-post'}blog_show{/url}">
        Read this blog post.
    </a>

Please see the `Symfony2 - Routing <http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/routing.html>`_ for full information about routing features and options in Symfony2.
    
Translation Extension
+++++++++++++++++++++

To help with message translation of static blocks of text in template context, the SmartyBundle, provides a translation extension. This extension is implemented in the class `TranslationExtension <https://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle/tree/master/Extension/TranslationExtension.php>`_.

You may translate a message, in a template, using a block or modifier. Both methods support the following arguments:
    - **count**: In pluralization context, used to determine which translation to use and also to populate the %count% placeholder *(only available in transchoice)*;
    - **vars**: `Message placeholders <http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/translation.html#message-placeholders>`_;
    - **domain**: Message domain, an optional way to organize messages into groups;
    - **locale**: The locale that the translations are for (e.g. en_GB, en, etc);
    
``trans`` block::

    {trans}Hello World!{/trans}
    
    {trans vars=['%name%' => 'World']}Hello %name%{/trans}

    {trans domain="messages" locale="pt_PT"}Hello World!{/trans}

    <!-- In case you're curious, the latter returns "Olá Mundo!" :) -->

``trans`` modifier::

    {"Hello World!"|trans}
    
    {"Hello %name%"|trans:['%name%' => 'World']}

    {"Hello World!"|trans:[]:"messages":"pt_PT"}


`Message pluralization <http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/translation.html#pluralization>`_ can be achieved using ``transchoice``:

    **Note:** Unlike the examples given in the `Symfony documentation <http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/translation.html#explicit-interval-pluralization>`_, which uses curly brackets for explicit interval pluralization we are using **square brackets** due to Smarty usage of curly brackets as syntax delimiters. So ``{0} There is no apples`` becomes ``[0] There is no apples``.

``transchoice`` block::
    
    {transchoice count=$count}[0] There is no apples|[1] There is one apple|]1,Inf] There is %count% apples{/transchoice}

``transchoice`` modifier::
    
    {'[0] There is no apples|[1] There is one apple|]1,Inf] There is %count% apples'|transchoice:$count}
    <!-- Should write: "There is 5 apples" -->
    
    The transchoice block/modifier automatically gets the %count% variable from the current context and passes it to the translator. This mechanism only works when you use a placeholder following the %var% pattern.


Enabling custom Extensions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable a Smarty extension, add it as a regular service in one of your configuration, and tag it with ``smarty.extension``. The creation of the extension itself is described in the next section.

YAML example::

    services:
        smarty.extension.your_extension_name:
            class: Fully\Qualified\Extension\Class\Name
            arguments: [@service]
            tags:
                - { name: smarty.extension }

Creating a Smarty[Bundle] Extension
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

    In version 0.1.0 class AbstractExtension was simply named Extension. Please
    update your code when migrating to 0.2.0.

An extension is a class that implements the `ExtensionInterface <https://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle/tree/master/Extension/ExtensionInterface.php>`_. To make your life easier an abstract `AbstractExtension <https://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle/tree/master/Extension/AbstractExtension.php>`_ class is provided, so you can inherit from it instead of implementing the interface. That way, you just need to implement the getName() method as the ``Extension`` class provides empty implementations for all other methods.

The ``getName()`` method must return a unique identifier for your extension::

    <?php

    namespace NoiseLabs\Bundle\SmartyBundle\Extension;

    class TranslationExtension extends AbstractExtension
    {
        public function getName()
        {
            return 'translator';
        }
    }

**Plugins**

Plugins can be registered in an extension via the ``getPlugins()`` method. Each element in the array returned by ``getPlugins()`` must implement `PluginInterface <https://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle/tree/master/Extension/Plugin/PluginInterface.php>`_.

For each Plugin object three parameters are required. The plugin name comes in the first parameter and should be unique for each plugin type. Second parameter is an object of type ``ExtensionInterface`` and third parameter is the name of the method in the extension object used to perform the plugin action.

Please check available method parameters and plugin types in the `Extending Smarty With Plugins <http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/plugins.tpl>`_ webpage.

::

    <?php

    namespace NoiseLabs\Bundle\SmartyBundle\Extension;

    use NoiseLabs\Bundle\SmartyBundle\Extension\Plugin\BlockPlugin;

    class TranslationExtension extends Extension
    {
        public function getPlugins()
        {
            return array(
                new BlockPlugin('trans', $this, 'blockTrans'),
            );
        }

        public function blockTrans(array $params = array(), $message = null, $template, &$repeat)
        {
            $params = array_merge(array(
                'arguments' => array(),
                'domain'    => 'messages',
                'locale'    => null,
            ), $params);

            return $this->translator->trans($message, $params['arguments'], $params['domain'], $params['locale']);
        }
    }

**Filters**

Filters can be registered in an extension via the ``getFilters()`` method.

Each element in the array returned by ``getFilters()`` must implement `FilterInterface <https://github.com/noiselabs/SmartyBundle/tree/master/Extension/Filter/FilterInterface.php>`_.

::

    <?php

    namespace NoiseLabs\Bundle\SmartyBundle\Extension;

    use NoiseLabs\Bundle\SmartyBundle\Extension\Filter\PreFilter;

    class BeautifyExtension extends Extension
    {
        public function getFilters()
        {
            return array(
                new PreFilter($this, 'htmlTagsTolower'),
            );
        }

        // Convert html tags to be lowercase
        public function htmlTagsTolower($source, \Smarty_Internal_Template $template)
        {
            return preg_replace('!<(\w+)[^>]+>!e', 'strtolower("$1")', $source);
        }
    }

**Globals**

Global variables can be registered in an extension via the ``getGlobals()`` method.

There are no restrictions about the type of the array elements returned by ``getGlobals()``.

::

    <?php

    namespace NoiseLabs\Bundle\SmartyBundle\Extension;

    class GoogleExtension extends Extension
    {
        public function getGlobals()
        {
            return array(
                'ga_tracking' => 'UA-xxxxx-x'
            );
        }
    }

Available options
+++++++++++++++++

allow_php_templates
    By default the PHP template file resource is disabled. Setting $allow_php_templates to TRUE will enable PHP template files.

auto_literal
    The Smarty delimiter tags ``{`` and ``}`` will be ignored so long as they are surrounded by white space. This behavior can be disabled by setting auto_literal to false.

autoload_filters
    If there are some filters that you wish to load on every template invocation, you can specify them using this variable and Smarty will automatically load them for you. The variable is an associative array where keys are filter types and values are arrays of the filter names.

cache_dir
    This is the name of the directory where template caches are stored. By default this is ``%kernel.cache_dir%/smarty/cache``. **This directory must be writeable by the web server**.

cache_id
    Persistent cache_id identifier. As an alternative to passing the same ``$cache_id`` to each and every function call, you can set this ``$cache_id`` and it will be used implicitly thereafter. With a ``$cache_id`` you can have multiple cache files for a single call to ``display()`` or ``fetch()`` depending for example from different content of the same template.

cache_lifetime
    This is the length of time in seconds that a template cache is valid. Once this time has expired, the cache will be regenerated. See the page `Smarty Class Variables - $cache_lifetime <http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/variable.cache.lifetime.tpl>`_ for more details.

cache_locking
    Cache locking avoids concurrent cache generation. This means resource intensive pages can be generated only once, even if they've been requested multiple times in the same moment. Cache locking is disabled by default.

cache_modified_check
    If set to ``TRUE``, Smarty will respect the If-Modified-Since header sent from the client. If the cached file timestamp has not changed since the last visit, then a '304: Not Modified' header will be sent instead of the content. This works only on cached content without ``{insert}`` tags.

caching
    This tells Smarty whether or not to cache the output of the templates to the ``$cache_dir``. By default this is set to the constant ``Smarty::CACHING_OFF``. If your templates consistently generate the same content, it is advisable to turn on ``$caching``, as this may result in significant performance gains.

caching_type
    This property specifies the name of the caching handler to use. It defaults to file, enabling the internal filesystem based cache handler.

compile_check
    Upon each invocation of the PHP application, Smarty tests to see if the current template has changed (different timestamp) since the last time it was compiled. If it has changed, it recompiles that template. If the template has yet not been compiled at all, it will compile regardless of this setting. By default this variable is set to ``TRUE``. Once an application is put into production (ie the templates won't be changing), the compile check step is no longer needed. Be sure to set $compile_check to ``FALSE`` for maximum performance. Note that if you change this to ``FALSE`` and a template file is changed, you will *not* see the change since the template will not get recompiled. If $caching is enabled and $compile_check is enabled, then the cache files will get regenerated if an involved template file or config file was updated. As of Smarty 3.1 ``$compile_check`` can be set to the value ``Smarty::COMPILECHECK_CACHEMISS``. This enables Smarty to revalidate the compiled template, once a cache file is regenerated. So if there was a cached template, but it's expired, Smarty will run a single compile_check before regenerating the cache.

compile_dir
    This is the name of the directory where compiled templates are located. By default this is ``%kernel.cache_dir%/smarty/templates_c``. **This directory must be writeable by the web server**.

compile_id
    Persistant compile identifier. As an alternative to passing the same ``$compile_id`` to each and every function call, you can set this $compile_id and it will be used implicitly thereafter. With a ``$compile_id`` you can work around the limitation that you cannot use the same ``$compile_dir`` for different ``$template_dirs``. If you set a distinct ``$compile_id`` for each ``$template_dir`` then Smarty can tell the compiled templates apart by their ``$compile_id``. If you have for example a prefilter that localizes your templates (that is: translates language dependend parts) at compile time, then you could use the current language as ``$compile_id`` and you will get a set of compiled templates for each language you use. Another application would be to use the same compile directory across multiple domains / multiple virtual hosts.

compile_locking
    Compile locking avoids concurrent compilation of the same template. Compile locking is enabled by default.

compiler_class
    Specifies the name of the compiler class that Smarty will use to compile the templates. The default is 'Smarty_Compiler'. For advanced users only.

config_booleanize
    If set to ``TRUE``, config files values of ``on/true/yes`` and ``off/false/no`` get converted to boolean values automatically. This way you can use the values in the template like so: ``{if #foobar#}...{/if}``. If ``foobar`` was ``on``, ``true`` or ``yes``, the ``{if}`` statement will execute. Defaults to ``TRUE``.

config_dir
    This is the directory used to store config files used in the templates. Default is ``%kernel.root_dir%/config/smarty``.

config_overwrite
    If set to ``TRUE``, the default then variables read in from config files will overwrite each other. Otherwise, the variables will be pushed onto an array. This is helpful if you want to store arrays of data in config files, just list each element multiple times.

config_read_hidden
    If set to ``TRUE``, hidden sections ie section names beginning with a period(.) in config files can be read from templates. Typically you would leave this ``FALSE``, that way you can store sensitive data in the config files such as database parameters and not worry about the template loading them. ``FALSE`` by default.

debug_tpl
    This is the name of the template file used for the debugging console. By default, it is named ``debug.tpl`` and is located in the ``SMARTY_DIR``.

debugging
    This enables the debugging console. The console is a javascript popup window that informs you of the included templates, variables assigned from php and config file variables for the current script. It does not show variables assigned within a template with the ``{assign}`` function.

debugging_ctrl
    This allows alternate ways to enable debugging. ``NONE`` means no alternate methods are allowed. ``URL`` means when the keyword ``SMARTY_DEBUG`` is found in the ``QUERY_STRING``, debugging is enabled for that invocation of the script. If ``$debugging`` is ``TRUE``, this value is ignored.

default_config_type
    This tells smarty what resource type to use for config files. The default value is ``file``, meaning that ``$smarty->configLoad('test.conf')`` and ``$smarty->configLoad('file:test.conf')`` are identical in meaning.

default_modifiers
    This is an array of modifiers to implicitly apply to every variable in a template. For example, to HTML-escape every variable by default, use ``array('escape:"htmlall"')``. To make a variable exempt from default modifiers, add the 'nofilter' attribute to the output tag such as ``{$var nofilter}``.

default_resource_type
    This tells smarty what resource type to use implicitly. The default value is file, meaning that ``{include 'index.tpl'}`` and ``{include 'file:index.tpl'}`` are identical in meaning.

default_config_handler_func
    This function is called when a config file cannot be obtained from its resource.

default_template_handler_func
    This function is called when a template cannot be obtained from its resource.

direct_access_security
    Direct access security inhibits direct browser access to compiled or cached template files. Direct access security is enabled by default.

error_reporting
    When this value is set to a non-null-value it's value is used as php's error_reporting level inside of ``display()`` and ``fetch()``.

escape_html
    Setting ``$escape_html`` to ``TRUE`` will escape all template variable output by wrapping it in ``htmlspecialchars({$output}``, ``ENT_QUOTES``, ``SMARTY_RESOURCE_CHAR_SET``);, which is the same as ``{$variable|escape:"html"}``. Template designers can choose to selectively disable this feature by adding the ``nofilter`` flag: ``{$variable nofilter}``. This is a compile time option. If you change the setting you must make sure that the templates get recompiled.

force_cache
    This forces Smarty to (re)cache templates on every invocation. It does not override the ``$caching`` level, but merely pretends the template has never been cached before.

force_compile
    This forces Smarty to (re)compile templates on every invocation. This setting overrides ``$compile_check``. By default this is ``FALSE``. This is handy for development and debugging. It should never be used in a production environment. If ``$caching`` is enabled, the cache file(s) will be regenerated every time.

locking_timeout
    This is maximum time in seconds a cache lock is valid to avoid dead locks. The deafult value is 10 seconds.

merge_compiled_includes
    By setting ``$merge_compiled_includes`` to ``TRUE`` Smarty will merge the compiled template code of subtemplates into the compiled code of the main template. This increases rendering speed of templates using a many different sub-templates. Individual sub-templates can be merged by setting the inline option flag within the ``{include}`` tag. ``$merge_compiled_includes`` does not have to be enabled for the inline merge.

php_handling
    This tells Smarty how to handle PHP code embedded in the templates. There are four possible settings, the default being ``Smarty::PHP_PASSTHRU``. Note that this does NOT affect php code within ``{php}{/php}`` tags in the template. Settings: ``Smarty::PHP_PASSTHRU`` - Smarty echos tags as-is; ``Smarty::PHP_QUOTE`` - Smarty quotes the tags as html entities; ``Smarty::PHP_REMOVE`` - Smarty removes the tags from the templates; ``Smarty::PHP_ALLOW`` - Smarty will execute the tags as PHP code.

plugins_dir
    This is the directory or directories where Smarty will look for the plugins that it needs. Default is ``plugins/`` under the ``SMARTY_DIR``. If you supply a relative path, Smarty will first look under the ``SMARTY_DIR``, then relative to the current working directory, then relative to the PHP include_path. If ``$plugins_dir`` is an array of directories, Smarty will search for your plugin in each plugin directory in the order they are given. **While using the SmartyBundle you may add plugins by setting services tagged with smarty.extension. See section Extensions for more information.**

smarty_debug_id
    The value of ``$smarty_debug_id`` defines the URL keyword to enable debugging at browser level. The default value is ``SMARTY_DEBUG``.

template_dir
    This is the name of the default template directory. If you do not supply a resource type when including files, they will be found here. By default this is ``%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/views``. ``$template_dir`` can also be an array of directory paths: Smarty will traverse the directories and stop on the first matching template found. **Note that the SmartyEngine included in this bundle already add the template directory of each registered Bundle**.

trusted_dir
    ``$trusted_dir`` is only for use when security is enabled. This is an array of all directories that are considered trusted. Trusted directories are where you keep php scripts that are executed directly from the templates with ``{include_php}``.

use_include_path
    This tells smarty to respect the ``include_path`` within the ``File Template Resource`` handler and the plugin loader to resolve the directories known to $template_dir. The flag also makes the plugin loader check the ``include_path`` for ``$plugins_dir``.

use_sub_dirs
    Smarty will create subdirectories under the compiled templates and cache directories if $use_sub_dirs is set to ``TRUE``, default is ``FALSE``. In an environment where there are potentially tens of thousands of files created, this may help the filesystem speed. On the other hand, some environments do not allow PHP processes to create directories, so this must be disabled which is the default. Sub directories are more efficient, so use them if you can. Theoretically you get much better perfomance on a filesystem with 10 directories each having 100 files, than with 1 directory having 1000 files. This was certainly the case with Solaris 7 (UFS)... with newer filesystems such as ext3 and especially reiserfs, the difference is almost nothing.
